## The *cleveref-usedon* package
Patches the cleveref package and adds forward-referencing functionality

## Introduction
Imagine you are reading a long mathematical text such as a text book or 
a thesis. There are plenty of supplementary lemmas, propositions, theorems 
and/or exercises throughout the whole text. 

You ask yourself *"Gosh, while Lemma 1.12 is certainly an interesting result 
\emph{where} is this result used later on in this long text? I really would find 
that helpful to decide \emph{why} I should read the proof."*

You can, of course, use the PDF search function of your viewer to look up the 
string *"Lemma 1.12"* but wouldn't it be more helpful if Lemma 1.12 already 
indicates all or at least its most useful/crucial applications via an info message?

This is what the package **cleveref-usedon** tries to address. 
The info message *"Used on p. 40, 43-45 and 101."* would then be 
printed to the header of Lemma 1.12.

Check the package documentation for more info and an example.
