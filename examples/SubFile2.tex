\subsection{Yet another subsection}
Here is yet another theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:TestTheoremSecond}
All rational numbers are real numbers.
\end{theorem}

Here, \cref{thm:TestTheoremSecond} has \emph{not} been called with \verb|UsedOn|. This is just the standard behaviour of the original \verb|cleveref| package.

There are more pages.

\clearpage
Just for the fun of it, let's call \cref[UsedOn]{thm:TestTheorem,lemma:TestLemma} again with option \verb|UsedOn|.

There is another section on the next page.
