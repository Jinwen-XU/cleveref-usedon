\usepackage[capitalise]{cleveref-usedon}
% If you have installed the package to a directory that latex understands, you can also do
% \usepackage[capitalise]{cleveref-usedon}
% This is a custom package, written by Sven Pistre.
% It patches cleveref and adds `UsedOn' functionality, see example below.
% Needs to be loaded AFTER hyperref because both hyperref and cleveref 
% update \label at the hook \AtBeginDocument and we want to use 
% cleveref's \label.
% For the various options of cleveref, check the cleveref documentation
% Here, we call it with option `capitalise'.

\crefname{page}{page}{pages}		% do NOT capitalise pages for more visual appeal

% The theorem editing interface, in particular, \declaretheorem needs to be executed 
% AFTER loading cleveref with the additional refname and Refname options
% see https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/498242/267438
% and the thmtools documentation

\section{Experimental options \texttt{UsedBy} and \texttt{UsedByAndOn}}
\label{sec:UsedByAndOn}
Unfortunately, due the way how this package is currently implemented, to get these
experimental options to work it is necessary to abuse the usage of proof environments.
Namely, one needs to nest the proof environment \emph{inside} the theorem-like environment.
Note carefully how the proof environments are (ab)used in the above code example.

This is -- as far is I know -- not how these environments are supposed to be used.
In particular, placing text between theorem-like environment and the corresponding proof,
as is often common, will result in a wrong reference. Namely, instead of referencing the
theorem-like environment by name only the corresponding section name would be printed, e.g.
``\emph{Used by \cref{sec:UsedByAndOn}.}''.
You can see this for yourself, if you move the proof environment out of the theorem-like
environment in the above examples.
Hence, using proof environments correctly results in messages which are less helpful to the reader.
On the other hand, using this experimental functionality to help the reader forces users (i.e. authors)
of this package to use proof environments incorrectly.
This sounds like a No-Free-Lunch theorem...
Therefore, use these experimental options at your own discretion!

The following shows the difference in behaviour if you use the proof environments as intended.
If you comment out lines 96-106 in this .tex file, then it will display the intended behaviour of this package. However, you need use the proof environment differently.

\begin{theorem}\label{lemma:SmoothFunction}
Let $f\colon M\to(0,1)$ be a smooth function.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item   \label{thm:Item1}
    	The function $f$ is continuous.
    \item   \label{thm:Item2}
    	The differential $\mathrm{d}f$ is continuous.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

The following works as you want.
\begin{lemma}\label{thm:Works}
Something about functions.
\begin{proof}
By \cref[UsedOn]{lemma:SmoothFunction} it's true. 
In particular, \cref[UsedBy]{thm:Item2} is helpful.
However, also \cref[UsedByAndOn]{thm:Item1} gives the result.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}\label{ex:Works}
Something about functions.
\begin{proof}
By \cref[UsedOn]{lemma:SmoothFunction} it's true. 
In particular, \cref[UsedBy]{thm:Item2} is helpful.
However, also \cref[UsedByAndOn]{thm:Item1} gives the result.
\end{proof}
\end{example}

The following does not work as you want because the proof environment is not nested inside the theorem-like environment.
Comment it out to see the behaviour in the theorem that you asked for.
\begin{example}\label{ex:DoesNotWork}
Something about functions.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
By \cref[UsedOn]{lemma:SmoothFunction} it's true. 
In particular, \cref[UsedBy]{thm:Item2} is helpful.
However, also \cref[UsedByAndOn]{thm:Item1} gives the result.
