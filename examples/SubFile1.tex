\section{The `cleveref-usedon' package}
\label{sec:TestSection}

This package patches a bug in the \verb|cleveref| package and adds the following functionality. If an environment, i.e. a theorem environment, has been labelled, it can be called with both \verb|\cref{<LabelName>}| as well as
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	\cref[UsedOn]{<LabelName>}
	\cref[uo]{<LabelName>}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
The option \verb|UsedOn| or the short form \verb|uo| is case-insensitive, i.e. you could also call it via
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
	\cref[UsEdOn]{<LabelName>}
	\cref[uO]{<LabelName>}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
--- but why would you?
This additional option adds the text \emph{Used on page(s) ... .)} to the beginning of the environment where the label has been originally set. If \verb|hyperref| has been loaded, there will also be hyperlinks to the corresponding pages from where the label has been referenced.

This might be a useful feature if you are writing a textbook or longer thesis and include various results early on but it is not yet clear why they are useful. 
Hopefully, the promise that this result 'is used on page...' will prompt your reader to keep reading.
Check the package documentation for more infos.

\subsection{An example}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:TestTheorem}
The identity
\begin{equation*}
	1=1
\end{equation*}
is true.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:TestLemma}
The identity
\begin{equation*}
	2=2.
\end{equation*}
is also true.
\end{lemma}

\par
Here, we reference \cref[UsedOn]{thm:TestTheorem} with option \verb|UsedOn|.

Here, we reference \cref[uo]{lemma:TestLemma} with option \verb|uo|.
\\

\subsection{Dummy text}
This is just some dummy text to generate pages.

\subsection{Continuation of example}
\par	
Here, we have referenced both \cref[uo]{thm:TestTheorem,lemma:TestLemma} and called them in one environment with option \verb|uo|. 
Note the lack of spaces in the braced arguments of \verb|\cref|! This is important as there will be a \LaTeX error when multiple labels are separated by commas AND spaces, i.e. it should be \\
\verb|\cref[uo]\{thm:TestTheorem,lemma:TestLemma\}|
\\
and NOT \\
\verb|\cref[uo]\{thm:TestTheorem, lemma:TestLemma\}|.
Check the documentation of the \verb|cleveref| package!	\\

The pdf goes on for a few more pages! Don't stop!
\clearpage
\par	
\Cref[UsedOn]{thm:TestTheorem} can also be called with option \verb|UsedOn| at the beginning of a sentence. One should then use \verb|\Cref| instead of \verb|\ref|. \\
\par	
\Cref[UsedOn]{lemma:TestLemma} can be similarly called at the beginning of a sentence with option \verb|UsedOn|. \\

Keep reading.

\clearpage
\par	\Cref[UsedOn]{thm:TestTheorem,lemma:TestLemma} are here called again in one single call of \verb|\Cref| with option \verb|UsedOn|.
